Assignment-10

Questions:
1.What happened to the HDFS file when one of the nodes it was stored on failed?
ANS: For our cluster with default replication factor of 3 and many DataNodes , when a single DataNode is down, the cluster continues normally. 
The data blocks in the DataNode that went down will be readily available in other alive DataNode (many copies).
If the DataNode is down for so long, the NameNode will re-replicate those data blocks to maintain the replication factor in the DataNodes. 

2.How did YARN/MapReduce behave when one of the compute nodes disappeared?
ANS: With dafault replication factor of 3, if the DataNode disappears, the tasks running in that node will fail and these failed tasks will be re-assigned to other DataNodes for re-execution. 
Therefore, there will not be any failed computation/execution for those tasks (just some delays for tasks to be re-scheduled and re-run in other node.)

3.Were there more things you'd like to try with this cluster, 
or anything you did try that you think should have been in this assignment?
ANS: Try all exercises with replication factor of 1 or one single DataNode. 
Try bringing down many DataNode at the same time and see how fast the NameNode responds. 
Try bringing down the NameNode???
